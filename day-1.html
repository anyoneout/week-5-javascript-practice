      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let noun = "peacock";
      let noun2 = "cauliflower";
      let noun3 = "scooter";
      let noun4 = "minivan";
      let verb = "sleeping";
      let verb2 = "running";
      let verb3 = "jumping";
      let verb4 = "skiing";
      let adjective = "grey";
      let adjective2 = "hard";
      let adjective3 = "soft";
      let adjective4 = "red";
      let adverb = "quickly";
      let adverb2 = "slowly";
      let adverb3 = "rarely";

      document.write(`Once upon a ${noun} dreary, while I pondered, ${adjective4} and ${adjective}, `);
      document.write("<br>");
      document.write(`Over many a ${adjective2} and ${adjective3} volume of ${noun4}— `);
      document.write("<br>");
      document.write(`While I nodded, ${adverb2} ${verb3}, ${adverb3} there came a ${verb2}, `);
      document.write("<br>");
      document.write(`As of some one ${adverb} ${verb}, ${verb4} at my chamber door. `)
      document.write("<br>");
      document.write(`“’Tis some ${noun2},” I muttered, “tapping at my ${noun3}— `)
      document.write("<br>");
      document.write(`Only this and nothing more.`)
